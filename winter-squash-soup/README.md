# 🥣 Winter Squash Soup

## 📋 Ingredients

* 1 large **Butternut Squash** (or Kabocha, see notes below)
* 4 cups Vegetable or Chicken Broth
* 1 large Onion, chopped
* 2 cloves Garlic, minced
* 1 tsp Ginger, minced (optional)
* 1/2 cup Heavy Cream or Coconut Milk (for richness)

## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

1.  **Roast the Squash:** Cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, and roast at **400°F (200°C)** for 30-40 minutes until tender.
2.  **Sauté Aromatics:** In a large pot, sauté the onion until soft. Add the garlic and ginger, cooking for 1 minute.
3.  **Combine & Simmer:** Scoop the roasted squash flesh into the pot. Add the broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes.
4.  **Blend:** Use an immersion blender or carefully transfer the soup to a regular blender and blend until completely smooth.
5.  **Finish:** Stir in the cream/coconut milk. Season with **salt and black pepper** to taste.

## ✨ Chef's Notes

* **Squash Choice:** Butternut yields the creamiest texture. Kabocha offers a deeper, nuttier flavor but can be slightly denser.
* **Garnish Ideas:** A swirl of chili oil, toasted pumpkin seeds, or a dollop of sour cream.
* **Spice Tip:** Add a pinch of nutmeg or a dash of cinnamon during the blending step for a warmer flavor.
