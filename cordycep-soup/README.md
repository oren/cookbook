# Cordyceps Flower Chicken & Pork Rib Soup


Ingredients

* 1 whole chicken leg (cut into pieces)
* 6–8 small pork ribs
* 1 handful cordyceps flowers
* 3–5 dried goji berries
* 2–3 slices of ginger
* 1 tied spring onion (a “scallion knot”)
* A few morel mushrooms (optional, but adds amazing flavor)
* Salt to taste
* Water


Instructions

* Blanch the pork ribs 
* Bring water to a boil, add the ribs, boil for 1–2 minutes, then rinse clean. This removes impurities and keeps the soup clear.
* Rinse the cordyceps flowers Just wash lightly and drain.
* Combine everything in a pot Add: chicken pieces, blanched ribs, ginger, the scallion knot, cordyceps flowers, and morel mushrooms.
* Add water Enough to cover everything by about 2 inches (5 cm).
* Simmer 

* Stovetop: low heat for 1.5–2 hours
* Instant Pot: “Soup” mode for 35–40 minutes
* Slow cooker: 4–6 hours on low

* Add goji berries Add them in the last 10 minutes so they stay sweet and not mushy.
* Season with salt Taste and adjust.

Tips

* Morel mushrooms make the soup very fragrant and “restaurant-level”.
* The longer it simmers, the richer and silkier the broth becomes.
